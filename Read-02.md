Creating a webpage is done through the adding of "Markup tags"

From book:
> Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs

> Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on

There are 6 levels of headings **H** tags. **H1 is main heading H2 is subheading followed by any subsequent headings**

**P** Is your paragraph tag

**B** Bold tag

**I** Itallic tag

**SUP** *From Book*: The <sup> element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power such
as 22.

**SUB** *From Book*: The <sub> element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas such as H20.

White space collapsing is the browsers ability to eliminate any unintentional spacing during code writing.

**BR** Line break tag to add a break inside of a paragraph tag.

**HR** Horizontal Rule tag to add a line break in between subjects.

*From Book*: There are a few elements that
do not have any words between
an opening and closing tag. They
are known as empty elements
and they are written differently.

**SEMANTIC MARKUP** Markup not used to change the way your page looks but more so to add understanding to how content should be read.

**STRONG** Tag indicates contents is important and is usually bold
